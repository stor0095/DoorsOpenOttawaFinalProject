# DoorsOpenOttawa

#### Android app that loads data from Doors Open Ottawa through Gerry's RESTful API.

### Note: Lines of code (LOC) does not include XML lines, only class based activities
### Note: LOC also doesn't include referencing variables such as referencing an EditText view or Imageview

### Note: My development process is to get the application to function before finishing up the design. Why waste hours on the design if nothing works? Forgive me for the current UI, given the current state of some features not working, the UI was pushed back.
